                <h3>International Workshop On Heterogeneous Networks Analysis And Mining</h3>
                <!--Monday, February 22, 2016-->
                <!--<br/>9:00 - 12:30-->
                <!--<br/>-->

                <div class="abstract">
                    Graphs naturally represent a host of processes, including interactions between people on social or
                    communication networks, links between webpages on the World Wide Web, protein interactions in
                    biological networks, movement in transportation networks, electricity delivery in smart energy
                    grids, relations in bibliographic data, and many others. In such scenarios, graphs that model
                    real-world networks are typically heterogeneous, multi-modal, and multi-relational. In the era of
                    big data, as more varieties of interconnected structured and semi-structured data are becoming
                    available, the importance of leveraging this heterogeneous and multi-relational nature of networks
                    in being able to effectively mine and learn this kind of data is becoming more evident. The
                    objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers from a variety of related areas, and
                    discuss commonalities and differences in challenges faced, survey some of the different approaches,
                    and provide a forum to present and learn about some of the most cutting-edge research in this area.
                    As an outcome, we expect participants to walk away with a better sense of the variety of different
                    methods and tools available for heterogenous network mining and analysis, and an appreciation for
                    some of the interesting emerging applications, as well as the challenges that accompany these
                    applications.
                    There are many challenges involved in effectively mining and learning from this kind of data,
                    including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understanding the different techniques applicable, including heterogeneous graph mining
                            algorithms, graphical models, latent variable models, matrix factorization methods and more.
                        </li>
                        <li>Dealing with the heterogeneity of the data.</li>
                        <li>The common need for information integration and alignment.</li>
                        <li>Handling dynamic and changing data.</li>
                        <li>Addressing each of these issues at scale.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Traditionally, a number of subareas have contributed to this space: communities in graph mining,
                    learning from structured data, statistical relational learning, and, moving beyond subdisciplines in
                    computer science, social network analysis, and, more broadly network science.

                        Real-world systems accumulate large-scale and various kinds of multimodal information rapidly,
                        including but not limited to text, image, video, audio, social relations, meta data, etc. Such
                        information has been incorporated in many recommendation models and systems to promote the
                        performance and user experience, giving rise to some of the recent and/or classical topics in
                        recommender system, such as review-based recommendation, image-based recommendation, explainable
                        recommendation, deep learning for recommendation, POI recommendation, video/music
                        recommendation,
                        and many others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Integrating multimodal side information is not a trivial task, because information may be either
                        homogenous or heterogeneous, which requires more advanced method for information fusion and
                        alignment. Besides, different information may play distinct roles for different domains, users,
                        and
                        tasks, and the availability of new information source may even lead to completely new
                        recommendation
                        research tasks. As a result, it needs significant efforts from both the research community and
                        industry to promote the recommendation system research and application in face of the various
                        information sources.

                        IFUP 2018 aims to provide a dedicated forum for discussing open problems, challenges and
                        innovative
                        research approaches in fusing multi-dimensional information for user modelling and recommender
                        systems. The major goal of this workshop is to promote advanced recommendation solutions that
                        can be
                        easily and readily deployed to meet industrial demands for personalized recommendation.

                    In recent years two sided marketplaces have emerged as viable business models in many real world
                    applications. In particular, we have moved from the social network paradigm to a network with two
                    distinct types of participants representing supply and demand of a specific good. Examples
                    industries include but are not limited to accommodation (Airbnb, Booking.com, HomeAway), video
                    content (YouTube, Dailymotion), Ridesharing (Uber, Didi, Lyft), online shops (Etsy, Ebay), music
                    (Soundcloud), app stores (Apple App Store, Google App Store) and job sites (LinkedIn).
                    The traditional research in most of these industries focused on satisfying the demand. OTAs would
                    sell hotel accommodation, TV networks would broadcast their own content or taxi companies would own
                    their own vehicle fleet. In modern examples like Airbnb, YouTube or Uber the platforms have
                    customers on the supply side as well, and have to optimize their models taking into consideration
                    host preferences, youtube producers and drivers. <br/>
                    The objective of this workshop is to bring practitioners of two-sided marketplaces together and
                    discuss the evolution of ranking, recommendation, matching and growth data mining to account for the
                    dual nature of the problem.

                        The Social Web for Disaster Management (SWDM) international workshop series, now in its fifth
                        edition, is a key venue for computer scientists, government officials, emergency agencies, and
                        other
                        interested participants to discuss technical issues and research challenges in the understanding
                        of
                        digitally-mediated, social and technical systems during mass emergencies. The workshop theme for
                        this year is "Collective Sensing, Trust, and Resilience in Global Crises," through which we aim
                        to
                        facilitate interdisciplinary discussion on a range of emergent challenges facing the world, from
                        harnessing big data on the Web that facilitates disaster and risk management, to engaging
                        citizen
                        participation in disaster response, establishing trust in global and local communities,
                        designing
                        socio-technical systems, and building resilience to disasters through Internet of Things and
                        ubiquitous intelligence.
                    </p>
                    To reflect the broad scope of topics relevant to this year's theme, we encourage submissions on
                    interdisciplinary research topics within the contexts of crisis informatics, risk, and disaster
                    management. The workshop will include a variety of submissions including regular papers, short
                    papers, and software system demonstrations in addition to its invited talks.

                <div class="abstract">
                    Networks are natural analytic tools in modeling adversarial activities (e.g., human trafficking,
                    illicit drug production, terrorist financial transaction) using different intelligence data sources.
                    However, such activities are often covert and embedded across multiple domains and contexts. They
                    are generally not detectable and recognizable from the perspective of an isolated network, and only
                    become apparent when multiple networks are analyzed in a joint manner. Thus, one of the main
                    research topics in modeling adversarial activities is to develop effective techniques to align and
                    fuse information from different networks into a unified representation for global analysis. Based on
                    the combined network representation, an equally important research topic is on detecting and
                    matching indicating patterns to recognize the underlining adversarial activities in the integrated
                    network. Two key challenge problems involved in the modeling process include: Network alignment and
                    merging - develop accurate and scalable methods for mapping of nodes across heterogeneous networks
                    based on different associational and causal dependencies.; Sub-graph detection and matching -
                    develop robust and efficient algorithms for richly attributed networks to support recognition of
                    complex query patterns for networks. The focus of this workshop is to gather together the
                    researchers from all relevant fields to share their experience and opinions on graph mining
                    techniques in the era of big data, with emphasis on two fundamental problems – “Connecting the dots”
                    and “finding a needle in a haystack”, in the context of graph-based adversarial activity analytics.

                    The success of data mining and search technologies is largely attributed to the efficient and
                    effective analysis of structured data. Construction of a well-structured, machine-actionable
                    database from raw data sources is often the premise of consequent applications. Automated
                    construction, mining and reasoning of the knowledge bases have become possible as research advances
                    in many related areas such as information extraction, natural language processing, data mining,
                    search, machine learning, databases and data integration. The 1st Workshop on Knowledge Base
                    Construction, Reasoning and Mining (KBCOM) is a new workshop that aims to gather together leading
                    experts from industry and academia to share their visions about the field, discuss latest research
                    results, and exchange exciting ideas. With a focus on invited talks and position papers, the

                        Web is a space for all where people interact with each other and anyone can read, publish, and
                        share content. While this has led to several groundbreaking benefits, it is also a breeding ground for
                        misbehavior and misinformation. Anyone can reach thousands of people on the web instantaneously,
                        say whatever they want, whenever they want, and yet be shielded by anonymity. This has led to
                        increase of misbehavior and misinformation, such as harrassment, scams, spread of propaganda, hate
                        speech, fake reviews, and many more. Study of this topic has become important among researchers across
                        many subfields of the computational and social sciences, such as social network analysis,
                        cybersecurity, human–computer interaction, linguistics, natural language processing, social psychology,

                    Search behavior, and information seeking behavior more generally, is often motivated by an
                    underlying need or task, such as finding a bus schedule to plan travel, finding a recipe to make a
                    dish for a potluck dinner, or finding the homepage of an author of a recently read book to see what
                    other books she has published. While contemporary search engines are good at helping people resolve
                    these types of look-up tasks, they are not as useful in helping people engaged in more complex tasks
                    whose resolution might require multiple search sessions and multiple search strategies. Instead,
                    search engines are optimized for particular types of tasks (e.g., look-up tasks and commerce tasks
                    such as travel and shopping), for particular types of search behaviors (i.e., enter a query, review
                    snippets, make a transaction) and for particular types of searchers (i.e., those who want to quickly
                    find a single piece of information). Search engines are not optimized for tasks that require
                    sustained interaction and engagement with information, the use of multiple, diverse search
                    approaches to finding information or for searchers who want to cultivate a deeper, internalized
                    understanding of a problem or topic. Contemporary search environments are tailored to support a
                    small set of basic search tasks and provide searchers with few options to search and interact with
                    information, and little to help them synthesize and integrate information across sessions. There is
                    a gradual shift towards searching and presenting the information in a conversational form. Chatbots,
                    personal assistants in our phones and eyes-free devices are being used increasingly more for
                    different purposes, including information retrieval and exploration. With improved speech
                    recognition and information retrieval systems, more and more users are increasingly relying on such
                    digital assistants to fulfil their information needs and complete their tasks. Beyond traditional
                    search environments, tasks help in providing an interpretable abstraction for grounding user
                    interactions with such novel interfaces. Task-IR 2018 will be a highly interactive full day workshop
                    that will provide a forum for academic and industrial researchers working at the intersection of
                    search tasks, conversational IR and user interactions. The purpose is to provide an opportunity for
                    people to present new work and early results, brainstorm different use cases, share best practices,
                    and discuss the main challenges facing this line of research.

                    Recommendation systems facilitate users retrieving contents they might like but not aware of yet. Furthermore, an effective recommendation system can potentially increase users’ retention and conversion rate. One critical challenge for building a recommender system lies in the existence of cold start cases when we have sparse records for certain users or items: without enough rating data about a new song or a new user, it is necessary to rely on auxiliary information to perform effective recommendation. In the first task of WSDM Cup 2018, we challenge the participants to solve the abovementioned challenges in building a music recommendation system. The 2nd task of the Cup focuses on churn prediction. For a subscription business, accurately predicting churn is critical to its long-term success as even a slight variation in churn can significantly affect the profits. In this task, participants are asked to build an algorithm that predicts whether a user will churn after their subscription expires. The competition data and award are provided by KKBOX, a leading music streaming service company from Taiwan. The competitions have attracted more than 1500 teams from all over the world to participate.
