                    <h4>Title: Countdown to Quantum Supremacy: An Update from the Google Quantum Artificial Intelligence
                        Lab
                    </h4>

                    <div class="talk-bio">Abstract: In this talk I will report about the effort at the Google Quantum AI
                        Lab to engineer a processor that is capable of passing the quantum supremacy frontier. This is
                        defined as the moment when a quantum processor becomes capable of executing a computational task
                        in a short time, say one second, while even the fastest classical supercomputer can not perform
                        this task within a reasonable time frame, say one year. Once the supremacy milestone is achieved
                        we plan to offer access to our quantum processors via Google Cloud for researchers and
                        practitioners to be able to explore their potential computational powers. I will then discuss
                        which useful applications we hope to run on such near-term quantum processors which have passed
                        the quantum supremacy frontier but do not yet possess enough qubits to perform quantum error
                        correction. I will intrioduce three application areas: quantum enhanced optimization, quantum
                        simulation and quantum neural networks. In particular I will report on i) quantum assisted
                        parallel tempering, a quantum enhanced optimization technique, that uses the physics of many
                        body delocalization to escape local minima ii) a recent breakthrough in quantum simulation that
                        suggests that one only needs a circuit of depth O(n) to perform electronic structure
                        calculations involving n spin orbitals and finally iii) first experiments to train quantum
                        neural networks.

                    <h4>Title: Using Deep Learning to Predict Emerging and Unidentified Clinical States</h4>
                    <p class="talk-bio">Abstract: Reducing costs in healthcare and improving care delivery rests on the ability to predict individual disease with precision, accuracy and speed. This demands the ability to combine, interpret, and take action on highly complex structured and unstructured data, with minimal error. But, most organizations lack the skills and manpower to do so, leading to labor-intensive, costly and inaccurate processes. Artificial intelligence can introduce the automation, computation and precision needed to transform healthcare operations–it's no small endeavor and requires sophisticated infrastructures and expertise. Lumiata’s predictive AI models clinical science and medicine, and is able to predict individual disease for 2 million people in under 2 hours, from over 5TB of data, with over 80% positive predictive value. Drawing from Lumiata’s experience and approach, this session discusses how to build and apply a real-world, practical AI to extract clinical value from data in ways that can improve the business of healthcare.

                    <h4>Title: Search Ranking And Personalization at Airbnb

                    </h4>
                    <p class="talk-bio">Abstract: Search ranking is a fundamental problem of crucial interest to major
                        Internet companies, including web search engines, content publishing websites and marketplaces.
                        However, despite sharing some common characteristics a one-size-fits-all solution does not exist
                        in this space. Given a large difference in content that needs to be ranked and the parties
                        affected by ranking, each search ranking problem is somewhat specific. Correspondingly, search
                        ranking at Airbnb is quite unique, being a two-sided marketplace in which one needs to optimize
                        for host and guest preferences, in a world where a user rarely consumes the same item twice and
                        one listing can accept only one guest for a certain set of dates. In this talk, I will discuss
                        challenges we have encountered and Machine Learning solutions we have developed for listing
                        ranking at Airbnb. Specifically, the listing ranking problem boils down to prioritizing listings
                        that are appealing to the guest but at the same time demoting listings that would likely reject
                        the guest, which is not easily solvable using basic matrix completion or a straightforward
                        linear model. I will shed the light on how we jointly optimize the two objectives by leveraging
                        listing quality, location relevance, reviews, host response time as well as guest and host
                        preferences and past booking history. Moreover, I will present our recent work on real-time
                        personalization in search ranking, where we leverage listing embeddings trained on historical
                        search sessions to enhance user’s future search experience by promoting similar content to the
                        one user recently interacted with. Finally, I will talk about how we train and use query
                        embeddings to provide better type-ahead suggestions and handle broad queries, in our case
                        queries with no explicit location.

                    <p class="talk-bio">Abstract: Snapchat at its core is the safest while funnest place for people to communicate with the ones they care about, and we believe advertising on Snapchat should follow the same philosophy by creating users experiences that are engaging, personalized, fun and privacy safe. Billions of ad requests are made from within the Snapchat app every day. Each of these requests requires either matching an existing ad to a user or actively choosing to not show ad at this time. This decision is made by taking into account many factors such as how much each ad is willing to pay, what events matter to each advertiser, how relevant each ad is to each user, how much we understand users, what they care about, where they go in the physical world, and what they consume across online and offline media, products and services and likelihood of achieving business objective for the advertiser. Moreover, we need to ensure that we’re properly balancing the revenue vs. user-sentiment trade-off, especially as our business continues to grow. We achieve these by processing petabytes of data and analyzing billions of users behavior signals daily. We use machine learning to create granular, context-aware predictive models for every single user. We build, measure and learn, and repeat this loop as fast as possible while remaining vigilant to details, anomalies and the impact on organic engagement of users on our platform.
