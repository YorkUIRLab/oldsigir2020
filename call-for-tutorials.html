                <h2>Call for Tutorials</h2>

                <p>SIGIR is the major international forum for the presentation of new research results and for the demonstration of new systems and techniques in the broad field of information access. 
                    SIGIR 2020 will take place in Xi'an, China, and includes a full day of tutorials on July XX, 2020.
 
                        SIGIR 2020 solicits proposals for both half and full-day tutorials covering topics relevant to the field of information retrieval and its applications. Each tutorial should cover a single topic in depth. 
                        For example, tutorials may cover an established information retrieval sub-topic, introduce an emerging application of information retrieval technologies, or update the information retrieval community on recent advances in related fields. 
                        We are especially interested in the third category of submission.
                </p>
