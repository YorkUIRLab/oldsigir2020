                    <p><strong>Submission Website:</strong> <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir2020"
                            target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir2020</a>

                    <p>
                        The annual SIGIR conference is the major international forum for the
                        presentation of new research results, and the demonstration of new
                        systems and techniques, in the broad field of information retrieval
                        (IR). The 43rd ACM SIGIR conference, to be held in Xi'an, China, welcomes
                        contributions related to any aspect of information retrieval and access,
                        including theories and foundations, algorithms and applications, and
                        evaluation and analysis.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The conference and short paper program chairs invite those working in
                        areas related to IR to submit <strong>original (four-page) short papers</strong>, which
                        will be presented as posters at the conference. Short papers present
                        original, previously unpublished work that make a novel research
                        contribution to the field. They provide an opportunity to describe
                        significant work in progress or research that is best communicated in an
                        interactive or graphical format. Compared to full papers, their
                        contribution may be narrower in scope, be applied to a narrower set of
                        application domains, or have weaker empirical support than that expected
                        for a full paper. Submissions likely to generate discussions in new and
                        emerging areas are especially encouraged. We welcome submissions in all
                        areas related to any aspect of IR, as identified in the call for full
                        papers on the conference website
                        (<a href="http://sigir.org/sigir2020/submit.html">http://sigir.org/sigir2020/submit.html</a>)
                        and repeated in the list below.
                    </p>

                    <p>Submissions will be peer reviewed, and accepted submissions will be
                        published in the conference proceedings. At least one author for each
                        accepted submission is required to register for the conference by the
                        early registration deadline. Furthermore, an author must be present at
                        the conference to present the work as a poster during the poster
                        session, where researchers can obtain direct feedback about their work
                        from a wide audience. Accepted submissions where authors fail to
                        register by the early deadline or cannot attend to present are subject
                        to being withdrawn from the conference proceedings at the discretion of
                        the chairs.&nbsp;A Best Short Paper Award will be awarded; nominations will
                        be decided based on reviewer assessments on the submitted version with
                        the Awards committee making the final decision among the nominees based
                        on review of the camera-ready version.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Deadlines: </h3>

                    <!-- <br /> -->

                    <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>

                    <p>All papers must be original works by the authors, previously
                        unpublished, and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or
                        conference. Submissions of short papers must be in English, in PDF
                        format, and should not exceed four (4) pages in the current ACM
                        two-column conference format (including references and figures).
                        Suitable LaTeX and Word templates are available from the <a
                            href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM
                            Website</a>.
                        Short papers must describe work that is not previously published, not
                        accepted for publication elsewhere, and not currently under review
                        elsewhere. Submissions should not contain any author identification and
                        should be submitted electronically via the <a
                            href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir2020">conference submission
                            system</a>.
                        The short-paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to
                        take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission.
                        While authors can upload to institutional or other preprint repositories
                        such as
                        <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a>&nbsp;before
                        reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places
                        anonymity at risk (which could result in a negative outcome of the
                        reviewing process). Submissions which violate the pre-print policy,
                        anonymity, length, or formatting requirements or are plagiarized are
                        subject to desk-rejection by the chairs. Authors should carefully go
                        through <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/authorship">ACM’s authorship
                            policy</a>&nbsp;before
                        submitting a paper. Authors should note that changes to the author list
                        after the submission deadline are <strong>not allowed&nbsp;without</strong> permission from
                        the PC Chairs.&nbsp; At least one author of each accepted paper is
                        <strong>required</strong> to register for, attend, and present the work at the conference.</p>

                    <p>
                        All short papers are to be submitted via EasyChair at
                        <a
